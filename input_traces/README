Think of this as an "integration test suite" library. We collect input
sequences here that have caused controllers problems previously. The inputs
themselves (link failures, VM migrations, policy changes) should be largely
decoupled from the details of the controller under test (i.e. the traces
should work for pox, Floodlight, Frenetic, etc.)

Input sequences are stored as a log of json objects, each separated by a
newline character.
